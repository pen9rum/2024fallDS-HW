## Course Topics

In this advanced programming course, we will cover fundamental algorithms and data structures with the aim of offering students a solid technical training in Java programming. Students will understand and use data structures effectively by studying their concepts and related Java programs. Lectures provide ideas and method descriptions, while labs focus on hands-on application development. Students will also learn to develop Java applications using Eclipse and the Java class library.

At the end of this course, students should understand common data structures and algorithms, and be able to apply that understanding to investigate new data abstractions, as well as use existing library components to develop middle-size applications. Students will also become better programmers and feel comfortable programming in Java.

Both basic and advanced data structures and their related algorithms will be discussed during the semester. The (tentative) topics include:

- A brief review of Java programming, object-oriented design, and analysis of algorithms
- Basic data structures: queues, stacks, linked lists, sequences, vectors, trees, heaps, and priority queues
- Advanced data structures: dictionaries, hash tables, maps, skip lists, search/balance/splay trees, directed/weighted graphs
- Fundamental algorithms: divide and conquer, merge/quick/bucket/radix sort, set partition, dynamic programming, greedy method, breadth-first search, depth-first search
- Advanced topics: topological sorting, pattern matching, text compression, task scheduling, transitive closures, strongly connected components, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees

## Course Requirements:

- **Lectures (30%)**:
  - One Midterm Exam (closed book) at the end of November
  - A Makeup Exam (optional) at the end of the semester
- **Labs (40%)**:  
  - Weekly Programming Assignments  
  - Program Prescreen in early November
- **Term Project (30%)**:  
  - Project demo in early January  
  - Including project proposal (20%), demo (40%), and implementation (40%)  
  - Teams of 3-5 students. Project details will be announced in early October.
  - [project preview]https://github.com/YiChingLLin/2022DataStructure/tree/master/Project
  
Please note that all slides/exams will be written in English for both Chinese and English sessions. Students are strongly encouraged to write their proposal and present their project in English.
